# Introduction

Next.js 14 brings exciting new features and improvements to the React framework. In this article, we'll explore the key updates and how to leverage them in your projects.

## Key Features

### Server Actions

Server Actions are now stable in Next.js 14. They allow you to define server-side functions that can be called directly from your components.

```javascript
async function createPost(formData) {
  'use server'
  
  const title = formData.get('title')
  const content = formData.get('content')
  
  // Save to database
  await db.post.create({ title, content })
}
```

### Partial Prerendering

This experimental feature allows you to combine static and dynamic content within the same route, providing the best of both worlds.

## Getting Started

To create a new Next.js 14 project, run:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use Server Components by default** - They reduce the JavaScript sent to the client
2. **Implement proper error boundaries** - Catch and handle errors gracefully
3. **Optimize images** - Use Next.js Image component for automatic optimization

## Conclusion

Next.js 14 continues to push the boundaries of what's possible with React applications. By understanding and utilizing these new features, you can build faster, more efficient web applications.
