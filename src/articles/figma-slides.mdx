Figma, at its last developer conference, which it calls Config, came out with four new products,
and while everyone is focusing on the AI product, it's actually the non-AI product that is taking
the design world by storm. Don't get me wrong. I think AI will probably have its place in the
future of Figma. I think that vibe coding is here to stay, or simply coding with AI,
we will probably drop the “vibe” at some point. But beyond that, Figma made a Google Slides competitor
that's actually the most interesting product launch they've done in the last 2 years.


Up until 2024, anyone not chained to the Microsoft enterprise slopware has been using Google Slides.
The reasons for that is obvious, the ability to collaborate on a document together, the ease
with which you can share it, set verbose permissions, it's free, doesn't require a download, made it
a clear upgrade over Powerpoint.

But overnight I saw the majority of people who make decks for a living, designers, completely
dump Google Slides for this new product. And this new product has flaws. It is not perfect.
When it released, fullscreen didn’t work, you couldnt present your slides without having
a top bar. There are still issues with Figma Slides, and yet it is clear that
designers are not going back to Google Slides anytime soon.


Part of that is the templates that Figma has put out look amazing right off the bat. I think
the design quality of these slide deck templates is on another level compared to the average deck I see.
But beyond that, the control Figma Slides gives you is also just way higher than the controls Google
Slides gives you. So many times when I have dumped screenshots or mocks into Google Slides I have thought,
“I wish rounding these corners wasn’t painful” or “I wish adding drop shadows wasn’t painful.” Now both are painless.

In Google Slides you have to crop a mask if you want rounded corners, and in the format options
you can add a drop shadow, but the controls are much less intuitive. In Figma, rounded corners
are always an option in the right side panel. And obviously drop shadows, blurred backgrounds, all of
the superior editing tools are available for you in the design mode.

What happened, Google? Part of this is I think them being complacent with Docs, Slides, and
Sheets. Part of it is Google is famously only focused on products that get them ad revenue.. I can
back this up from 4 years working there. They did a visual refresh a year or two back, and it was a
good update from Google. But the top bar having every single modifiable option you can feasibly do
on slides gives it the feel of Excel or PowerPoint. Google Slides has always felt like a word
processor with slide deck functionality built on top of it, instead of a slide deck tool with nice
features layered on top.


To be fair, Google Slides was still an improvement over Microsoft PowerPoint. It was an
improvement over Apple Keynote too. But we are slowly moving away from top panel master layouts
to multiple panel layouts. Figma Slides has two modes, Slide Deck mode and Design mode. In
Design mode, the layer panel pulls up from the bottom left, and you can group things and
introduce auto layouts.


Google touted adding AI into all of its products at it's last earnings call. Figma Slides also
has AI in the bottom action bar, but I have <i>never used AI when making a slide deck</i>. I
use AI a ton when I code, I used AI a ton to make this website. But when I make a deck, all I
want is the ability to easily add strokes, drop shadows, corner radius, opacity, colors,
styles, gradients. All of these were possible in Google Slides, but none of it was easy, and
none of it felt built for the designer. Figma has always been designer focused, and they made
Figma Slides with the same mindset.


They give you four border options that are easily clickable but allow you to do anything you
want. They give you four shadow options that are easily clickable but let you do whatever you
want. Alignment is easier.


What really sucks is that I think it's going to take a long time for the rest of the industry
to catch up to this change. I know engineers do not like being in Figma already. No chance PM's
are going to switch for auto layouts they already hate because it means they can move things
around easily. But I am not making another slide deck in Google Slides. I'm just not going to
do it.


Sharing is Figma Slide's largest flaw, and it's not even their fault. When I share a deck out
on Google Slides, I know my execs are logged into their Google Workspace accounts and will have
access to my slide deck. To the contrary they are not logged in to any Figma account. I don't
imagine my CEO knew what Figma was until the IPO. Do most CTO's know what Neovim is? Probably
not. Yet I would bet my life their most impactful engineers are die-hard Neovim users.


This is a weird crossroads. I wasn't there at the beginning of the Google Slides era, when
everyone was using Microsoft PowerPoint, but I imagine it was a hard shift for the early
adopters. I bet it was easier to leave a company, then it was to get people out of sharepoint,
outlook, and powerpoint.


In this era, I need to use Figma Slides to keep up with the times, but I know the rest of my
industry is not coming with me. Zero chance engineers are making Figma slide decks within the
next year. Zero chance most PMs are making Figma slide decks. Zero chance any of the core
people who make decks occasionally are going to switch over as quickly as I have seen designers
do it.


So I get caught in two worlds. My PM is going to ask me over the next week to make a critical
deck in Google Slides because she needs to share it with her boss, and I'm going to say no. To
give him access, he needs to log into his corporate account or have a corporate account, unless
I make it available to the entire internet. I'm going to say no, make an account , log in, it's
not rocket science. I'm not going back.


And that's about as strong a statement I can say on how good Figma Slides is. Good job Figma team.
