                        I currently lead end to end design for our mobile apps. In just three years,
                        I&apos;ve shipped more projects here than in the previous seven combined. That&apos;s
                        been possible thanks to minimal red tape, a high level of trust, and the freedom
                        to improve the experience wherever I and the team see a need.

                        I consider YouTube my real start. Great people, awesome product, but I was still a
                        small cog in a big machine. I worked on double tap to seek, player improvements,
                        queuing, the mini-player, playlists, the library tab, and Shorts.

                        First job out of college. Learned a ton about users, but also the negatives of how large companies function.
                        I left the team quickly because I wanted to work on teams where I could have a larger impact.
