import { ResponsiveImage } from '../components/ResponsiveImage';
import grid from '../assets/images/articles/grid.png';


You can also use `inline code`

- Pull quotes with three different styles
- Separate hero images for desktop and mobile
  - And this one too
    - Even deeper nesting works

1. Start with a compelling title
2. Add metadata in the frontmatter
3. Choose appropriate hero images

This pull quote uses an h4 tag, extends 160px to the left, and ends halfway across the page.
Perfect for supporting quotes or interesting details.

# JavaScript Example

```javascript
// Example React component
const ArticleCard = ({ title, date, excerpt }) => {
  const [isHovered, setIsHovered] = useState(false);

  return (
    <article
      className="article-card"
      onMouseEnter={() => setIsHovered(true)}
      onMouseLeave={() => setIsHovered(false)}
    >
      <h3>{title}</h3>
      <time dateTime={date}>{formatDate(date)}</time>
      <p>{excerpt}</p>
      {isHovered && <span>Read more â†’</span>}
    </article>
  );
};
```

# Images and Media

You can import and use images within your article. Here's an example of an inline image:

<img src={grid} alt="Example grid layout from Figma showing Auto Layout controls" />
<ResponsiveImage
  desktop={flower}
  mobile={flower}
  alt="Flower with custom styling"
  className="my-custom-class"
/>

Images can be placed anywhere in your article and will be responsive. The alt text is important for accessibility.

# Tables

While not as common, you can also create tables in MDX:

| Feature | Description | Usage |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| Pull Quotes | Large, emphasized text | Use h2, h3, or h4 |
| Code Blocks | Syntax highlighted code | Triple backticks with language |
| Images | Responsive images | Import and use img tag |
| Lists | Ordered and unordered | Standard markdown syntax |

## Blockquotes

> Sometimes you want to quote someone else or highlight important information. Blockquotes are perfect for this. They stand out from regular text and draw the reader's attention.
>
> You can even have multiple paragraphs in a blockquote.
