## Git Concepts for Designers

### Key Terms
- **Repository (Repo)**: A project folder tracked by Git
- **Fork**: Your personal copy of someone else's repository
- **Clone**: Download a repository to your computer
- **Branch**: An independent line of development (like a Figma branch)
- **Commit**: A saved snapshot of your changes (like saving a Figma file)
- **Push**: Upload your changes to GitHub
- **Pull**: Download changes from GitHub

### Visual Workflow
```
Cursor (Edit)    →    GitHub Desktop (Save)    →    GitHub.com (Share)
     ↓                        ↓                           ↓
  Make changes          Commit changes              Push to cloud
```

## GitHub Desktop Workflow

### Making Changes
1. **Edit files** in Cursor
2. **See changes** in GitHub Desktop (left sidebar)
3. **Review changes** in the diff view (right panel)
4. **Write commit message** (bottom left)
5. **Click "Commit to [branch]"**
6. **Push changes** with "Push origin" button

### Common Actions in GitHub Desktop

| Action | How to Do It |
|--------|-------------|
| See what changed | Look at the "Changes" tab |
| Save your work | Write message → Commit |
| Upload to GitHub | Click "Push origin" |
| Get latest changes | Click "Fetch origin" → "Pull" |
| Switch branches | Current Branch dropdown → Select |
| Create new branch | Current Branch → New Branch |
| Undo last commit | History → Right-click → "Undo Commit" |
| Discard changes | Right-click file → "Discard Changes" |

## Troubleshooting

### Can't sign in to GitHub Desktop
- Make sure you're using the right email/password
- Try signing in through the browser instead
- Check if two-factor authentication is enabled

### "Repository not found" when cloning
- Make sure you forked it first
- Refresh the repository list (Cmd/Ctrl + R)
- Try cloning from URL instead

### Changes not showing up
- Save your files in Cursor first (Cmd/Ctrl + S)
- Click "Fetch origin" to refresh
- Make sure you're on the right branch

### Merge conflicts
- Don't panic! This happens when two people edit the same file
- GitHub Desktop will show you the conflicts
- Click "Open in Cursor" to resolve
- Ask Cursor's AI: "Help me resolve this merge conflict"

### "Failed to push"
- Click "Fetch origin" first
- You might need to pull changes before pushing
- Check if you have write access to the repository

## Post-Setup Verification

### Check Everything is Working:

1. **GitHub Desktop**
   - Can you see your cloned repository?
   - Does it show your GitHub username in the top left?
   
2. **Cursor**
   - Can you open your project from GitHub Desktop?
   - Try making a small change to see if it appears in GitHub Desktop
   
3. **Test the Workflow**
   - Make a small edit (like adding your name to a README)
   - See the change in GitHub Desktop
   - Commit with a message like "Test commit"
   - Push to GitHub
   - Check github.com to see if your change is there!

## Creating Your First Pull Request

### With GitHub Desktop:
1. **Make your changes** and commit them
2. **Push to GitHub** (Push origin button)
3. **Click "Create Pull Request"** button in GitHub Desktop
4. This opens GitHub in your browser
5. **Add a title** describing what you changed
6. **Add a description** with more details
7. **Click "Create pull request"**
8. Wait for review and feedback!

### Pull Request Best Practices:
- Keep changes small and focused
- Write clear commit messages
- Test your changes first
- Add screenshots if it's visual
- Be patient with feedback
