# Go Basics

Go (often referred to as Golang) is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed at Google. It's known for its simplicity, efficiency, and excellent support for concurrent programming.

## Why Go?

Go was created to address common criticisms of other languages while maintaining their positive characteristics:

- **Simple and readable** - Clean syntax that's easy to learn
- **Fast compilation** - Compiles to machine code quickly
- **Garbage collected** - Automatic memory management
- **Built-in concurrency** - Goroutines and channels for concurrent programming
- **Standard library** - Rich set of built-in packages

## Installing Go

To get started with Go, you'll need to install it on your system:

### macOS
```bash
brew install go
```

### Linux
```bash
wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.21.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.21.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
```

### Windows
Download the installer from [go.dev](https://go.dev/dl/) and run it.

## Your First Go Program

Create a file called `hello.go`:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```

Run it with:
```bash
go run hello.go
```

## Basic Syntax

### Variables

Go has several ways to declare variables:

```go
// Explicit type declaration
var name string = "John"
var age int = 30

// Type inference
var city = "New York"  // Go infers string type

// Short declaration (only inside functions)
country := "USA"       // := declares and initializes
```

### Data Types

Go has several built-in data types:

```go
// Basic types
var b bool = true
var s string = "hello"
var i int = 42
var f float64 = 3.14

// Composite types
var arr [5]int                    // Array
var slice []int                   // Slice
var m map[string]int             // Map
var ch chan int                  // Channel
```

### Functions

Functions are first-class citizens in Go:

```go
// Basic function
func add(x int, y int) int {
    return x + y
}

// Multiple return values
func swap(x, y string) (string, string) {
    return y, x
}

// Named return values
func split(sum int) (x, y int) {
    x = sum * 4 / 9
    y = sum - x
    return  // "naked" return
}
```

## Control Structures

### If Statements

```go
if x > 0 {
    fmt.Println("x is positive")
} else if x < 0 {
    fmt.Println("x is negative")
} else {
    fmt.Println("x is zero")
}

// If with initialization
if v := math.Pow(x, n); v < limit {
    return v
}
```

### Loops

Go has only one looping construct: `for`

```go
// Traditional for loop
for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
    fmt.Println(i)
}

// While-style loop
for x < 100 {
    x += x
}

// Infinite loop
for {
    // Break or return to exit
}

// Range loop
numbers := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
for index, value := range numbers {
    fmt.Printf("Index: %d, Value: %d\n", index, value)
}
```

## Next Steps

Now that you understand the basics of Go, you're ready to explore more advanced topics:

- Structs and methods
- Interfaces
- Error handling
- Goroutines and concurrency
- Package management
- Testing

Go's simplicity makes it easy to learn, but it's powerful enough to build large-scale applications. Keep practicing and exploring the standard library!
